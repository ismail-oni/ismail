            <h3> <i>what is dragon ball? </i></h3>
            <p>Dragon Ball is, basically, a martial arts story with elements of fantasy, science fiction and comedy. The
                hero,
                Goku, is a boy with a monkey's tail (or not, in the live-action version) who is raised in the woods by a
                martial
                artist. Bulma, a girl on a quest for the seven magic Dragon Balls (a treasure which can grant any wish),
                accidentally discovers the guileless Goku and introduces him to civilization. Over many adventures, Goku
                travels
                around the world, develops his already prodigious fighting skills, and saves the world from evil martial
                artists
                many times over.</p>
